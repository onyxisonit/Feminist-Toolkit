          <p>by Alison Bechdel</p>
    <div class= "image_overlay image_overlay-blur">
     
      <div class= "image_title">Fun Home is a graphic memoir depicting Alison Bechdel’s fraught relationship with her father as she grew up. The misery and humor of Alison’s relationship with her distant yet meticulous father cumulate when Alison, who had recently come out as a lesbian, discovered that her father was also gay. A few weeks after this revelation, he was dead, leaving a legacy of mystery for his daughter to resolve. Fun Home is a daughter's effort to make sense of her father's life and death as well as an account of growing up uncomfortable in her skin. It is a personal account of knowing you are different but being afraid of acknowledging it for fear of everything that might change. It's a story of coming to terms with who you are.
</div>
      <p class= "image_descp">I resonated with Bechdel’s distance from her family. Years ago, I disassociated myself from my parents. After the third time, I tried to come out to my mother as pansexual. I knew that she already knew, and I knew she was still denying it with all her heart. I was tired of trying to be someone that only existed in my parents' eyes. Fun Home reminds me of my own relationship, or the lack thereof, with my parents. Although Alison copes with the secrets she finds out about her father, I knew a long time ago that I would never find those secrets out. I have accepted my distance from my parents, and I have never been more honest with them. This book has helped me feel seen in my tumultuous relationship with my family. It has helped me in the process of growing up, of becoming, of being happy in my own skin, and in accepting myself even if my parents do not.

    <p>By Judith Butler & Michel Foucault, respectively. </p>
      <div class= "image_overlay image_overlay-blur">
      <div class= "image_title">Judith Bulter was my introduction to reading feminist scholarship. Even though I still don’t fully understand what Judith Butler and Michel Foucault are saying, I think of their main assertions often in my day-to-day life. In particular, I ponder over their books “Bodies that Matter” and “Discipline and Punishment”, respectively. I read Foucault’s “Discipline and Punishment” first, and was captivated by the notion of the panopticon as a metaphor for society. It made sense to me: the reification of social norms through self-disciplining out of fear of the possibility of other people disciplining, policing, or judging you. Judith Butler reframed Foucault’s claims through the lens of gender and sex.</div>
      <p class= "image_descp">The most notable assertion from Butler’s “Bodies that Matter” is the conflation of sex and gender. Butler argues that “sex does not accrue social meanings…rather [it] is replaced by the social meanings it takes on…gender…absorbs and displaces ‘sex’” (238). In other words, sex is gender and gender is sex. Sex is as socially constructed as gender. Constructionism is defined by Butler as a reiteration of norms taking place in time. Interestingly, the construction of sex produces and reproduces the norms of sex, while simultaneously destabilizing it. Through constructing sex, bodies outside of the norm arise and undermine the definition of the normatively of sex. One of the ways in which sex is produced and reinforced is through gender performativity, which is also defined as a process of reiteration. However, performativity is not necessarily a performance by an actor, rather it is devoid of agency, and is a “forcible and reiterative practice” (242).</p> 

<p class= "image_descp">After reading Foucault and Butler for the first time, I remember going through an existential crisis. I suddenly felt stripped of all my agency, powerless against the larger societal, cultural, and environmental forces around me. I constantly questioned everything. How can we overcome reiterating the norm? And what is resistance, necessarily? A form of resistance to one sex can be gender expression “more like the other sex”, which further would reinforce the norms of sex. How can we overcome the norms when it is already so naturalized and inscribed within our society?</p>  

<p class= "image_descp">Although I still do not have answers to my questions after the fourth time reading Butler this semester, I now recognize that the importance is in the act of asking questions itself. Power lies within curiosity. Foucault and Butler provoked me, and they continue to do so. I return to them when I feel too comfortable within myself. I return to them when I need a reminder that not everything is as “it is”. I return to them when I need validation of my subjective morals and to help me recreate a space where I believe in my lived experiences, and in myself.</p>

    <h2>Fleabag</h2>
    <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages-na.ssl-images-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2F91atIIgkN%2BL._RI_.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=8124e1dbbee75bbbadafbed8a25c92f52aca282ef30e7a2adffad59d3eb3e269&ipo=images" alt="picture" style= "height:550px;">
        <p>Created and Written By Phoebe Waller-Bridge
</p>
      <div class= "image_overlay image_overlay-blur">
      
      <div class= "image_title">Fleabag craftily weaves together the joys and sorrows of being a woman- as a friend, a sister, a daughter, and as an individual. The Amazon Prime show follows a woman coping with the loss of her friend. The undertone of grief, guilt, regret, and shame contrasts with the stark,  snarky, and sarcastic nature of Fleabag. The main protagonist is never named in the show, only cleverly referred to by viewers as Fleabag. The namelessness represents the shared glories and struggles of being a woman. The audience is able to witness and connect with Fleabag in her public and personal life; rawly channeled through her relationships in the show- what she does, what she says, how she is treated- and her inner thoughts- how she feels, what she desires, what she thinks. Fleabag constantly breaks the fourth wall in the show, even referring to the audience as her friends in one episode. 
</div>
      <p class= "image_descp">And honestly, I feel like Fleabag’s friend. Fleabag says and does what she wants, even if she knows she should not or recognizes that she will feel guilt and shame from it afterward. 
She reminds me that despite how others perceive me, I can extricate myself from the pervasive social noise on how to be a “happy, successful, good woman.” She encourages me to do as I please, even if I will feel shame or guilt afterward, because that is what I feel at the moment.
</p>
        <p class= "image_descp">The theme of dissatisfaction yet comfort woven into her sexual and romantic relationships is what makes Fleabag particularly relatable to me. Fleabag does not seem content in these particular areas of her life, yet she carries out the same actions out of habit and familiarity. And that is okay. Progress is not linear nor is it instantaneous. Especially when discussing stigmatized topics like sex, breaking out of your comfort zone can be confusing and discomforting. Yet change is inevitable. Through Fleabag, I am comforted with the certainty of change. Since change is the only constant, everything you do is pointlessly significant. So, like Fleabag, I will do as I please, speak my truth, and experience my life from moment to moment.

      <div class= "image_title">I do not know when I happened upon this Instagram page. But once I saw it I was hooked. @christopher___scangas posts images and artworks that explore female sexuality, which one may argue is for the male gaze. Yet, these photos displayed something more to me than an exploitation of the female body. The dark- almost perverted- undertones of this account represented an expression of sexuality free from shame. This account reminds me that the stigma we tie to the female body and sex is because of what we were taught throughout our lives. Rather than suppressing women’s sexual desire, @christopher___scangas highlights that the female body is a beautiful work of art.
</div>
      <p class= "image_descp">@christopher___scangas is a photomontage encouraging the freedom of sexual expression- of being content, satisfied, and empowered to eroticism. In the article “Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power”, Audre Lorde states “When I speak of the erotic, then, I speak of it as an assertion of the lifeforce of women; of that creative energy empowered, the knowledge and use of which we are now reclaiming in our language, our history, our dancing, our loving, our work, our lives.” The erotic does not only refer to sex. Rather, it is an emotional force that is a source of motivation, joy, connection, and power. Lorde notes that the erotic “lies in a deeply female and spiritual plane” (53) which is why it has been “vilified, abused, and devalued within western society.” (53) She poignantly argues that as women, we have learned to say no to ourselves, distrusting and denying our powers. We too often have turned away from the exploration and consideration of the erotic, demoting it to pornography, because we live in a patriarchal society (55).</p>
        
 <p class= "image_descp">I recognize the “chaos of our strongest feelings” (54) on @christopher___scangas's Instagram page. Although eroticism here is mainly portrayed through sex and the physical body, I feel spiritually empowered and satisfied when witnessing the transformation of the female body into art. To me, art can transform any individual’s deepest desires, gratifications, and vexations into a comprehensible form. Art validates the subject as much as the subject validates it. Scrolling on @christopher___scangas, I am unencumbered by the shame of my body, the shame of sex, the shame of pleasure.

      <div class= "image_title">“I was at a loss.” I am at a loss. Sometimes I feel scrambled and disfigured; my heart an abyss, my mind a void, while I wrap myself in thorns. Naked, I cover my face leaving my bleeding body to be witnessed by the world.</div>
      <p class= "image_descp">
When I was a child, I was sexually abused by my parents' worker. For years and years and years, I believed that I liked it, that I wanted it.</p>
        <p class= "image_descp">I was a slut, wanting innocence.</p>
<p class= "image_descp">The distorted chaos of figures and objects represent the internal havoc trailing from my sexual abuse. I acknowledge that I will carry those thorns on my back for the rest of my life. Although Korean artist Kim Jae Jun's dystopian paintings are inspired by a critique of the Internet and Korean-pop culture, the painting resonates with me differently. The hypersexualized bodies remind me of how I viewed myself- a body with no face. The soldiers remind me of the stories I repressed- a truth too hard to bear. The chaos throughout and the bodies mutating into the objects is a representation of my mind- a disorder too messy to fully process.</p>
<p class= "image_descp">I see my story painted in oil and acrylic. I see my story when I hear others’ stories. I see my shame and denial in so many other people’s eyes. I am reminded through this painting that I am, unfortunately, not alone. I am part of a collective, prickly web of pain and guilt. Yet, I am not trapped by my trauma. I am seen, heard, and loved, even if others are unaware that it is because of them. I now feel empowered in my body, naked and scarred. I understand true pleasure, rather than prescribed pleasure. Through others being open, compassionate, and expressive, I have learned to hold space for myself; to process my memories, my pain, and my shame; and to express myself as I please. I have progressed so far.
And I can only keep moving forward.
